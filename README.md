This is a (minor) port of [HonkPerf.Net](https://github.com/asc-community/HonkPerf.NET) and inclusion of some minor [Silk.Net](https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET) dependencies, mainly to be used with Unity.

All files are .NET Framework 4.8 compatible and can simply be dropped in the "Assets" folder of a Unity project.
